                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My journey once started back in elementary school when I was asked about who I wanted to do my
                    autobiography on: Bill Gates in 5th grade in Ms. Franklin's room 143.</p>
                <p>Once we picked our person for the autobiography, I began my research on Bill Gates on my Xbox 360
                    for hours every day for a week straight. There was something I felt—a connection between me and
                    Bill Gates.</p>
                <p>Because we both have something in common that we both enjoy: technology and how we could improve
                    it in the future. Computing inventions became my passion when I was 11 years old, so I wanted
                    this career for up to 7 years, and hopefully, I can achieve this goal that I am striving for.
